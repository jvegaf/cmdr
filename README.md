## Description

CMDR is a TSI mappings editor for NI Traktor Pro. It supports TP3.3 and specific controllers like S4MK3.

Use CMDR to edit TSI files with basic features missing in Traktor's Controller Manager:
* Copy-Paste
* Mass-Edit
* Mass-Automation
* plus much more ([Full Changelog](docs/development/Change_Log.md))

CMDR is a Windows application, but there are several ways to [run it in you macOS](docs/running_on_macos.md).

## 🚀 Migration to Cross-Platform (In Progress)

We are actively migrating CMDR from .NET/WPF to a cross-platform **Electron + React** application. This will enable native support for:

- ✅ **Windows** 
- ✅ **Linux**
- ✅ **macOS** (native, no Wine/Parallels needed)

### Migration Status

|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Infrastructure Base (monorepo, packages) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 | TSI Parser - Binary Format | 🔄 In Progress |
| 3 | TSI Parser - XML & Integration | ⏳ Pending |
| 4 | Domain Models | ⏳ Pending |
| 5 | UI Shell | ⏳ Pending |
| 6-21 | Full UI, MIDI Learn, etc. | ⏳ Pending |

**Details:** [Migration Plan](docs/development/MIGRATION_PLAN.md) | [Task List](docs/development/MIGRATION_TASKS.md)

### New Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Desktop:** Electron with electron-vite
- **State:** Zustand
- **MIDI:** WebMIDI API
- **Testing:** Vitest (35+ tests passing)
